  #    These responses are always untagged.  This is how changes in the size
  #    of the mailbox are transmitted from the server to the client.
  #    Immediately following the "*" token is a number that represents a
  #    message count.

  #    Example:    S: * 23 EXISTS
  rfc3501_7.3.1_EXISTS_response_example:
    :response: "* 23 EXISTS\r\n"
    :expected: !ruby/struct:Net::IMAP::UntaggedResponse
      name: EXISTS
      data: 23
      raw_data: "* 23 EXISTS\r\n"

  # 7.3.2.  RECENT Response
